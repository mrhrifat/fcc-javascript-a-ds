## JavaScript
JavaScript is the most popular Programming language in the world. Over [97%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#cite_note-deployedstats-12) of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 

## Why JavaScript?
Why not? All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. It can be used in Front-end, Back-end, Android, IOS, Desktop & AI also.

## JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures
It's not enough to know how to write a simple program to do something. You need to know how to write a program that can solve a problem with the most efficient way. That's why we need to know Algorithms & Data Structures. This repository contains a collection of JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Code.

## Motive
It will be helpful for  any future Programmer, who want to learn JavaScript from `Basic` to `Advance` by practice & solving problem. It will be a good experience to for Programmers because of the following reasons:
- Codes are written from scratch to advance.
- These are the code of [freeCodeCamp](#free-code-camp) course.
- All codes are written in JavaScript.
- Easy to understand.

## Free Code Camp
In this repository all programming problem is taken from online learning site called, Free Code Camp. <br>
**Before this**, I created this repository in April 21 but unfortunately because of some terminal issues, I have to delete this. So again now I am going to create new and solve problem again with much better knowledge. 

## Lesson
- Basic JavaScript
- ES6
- Regular Expression
- Debugging
- Basic Data Structure
- Basic Algorithm Scripting
- Object Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming 
- Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
- Project
